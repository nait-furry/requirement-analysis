# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs or expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified product. This process ensures that the software will meet business goals and user needs effectively.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Clarity & Alignment
It ensures that everyone involved—clients, developers, designers, testers—has a shared understanding of what the software must do.

Prevents Rework
By catching misunderstandings or missing requirements early, it reduces the need for costly changes later in development.

Guides Development
Clearly defined requirements act as a blueprint for developers and serve as a foundation for project planning and design decisions.

Improves Quality
Well-analyzed requirements lead to systems that are more likely to meet user expectations and perform reliably.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Elicitation: Interviewing stakeholders, observing workflows, conducting surveys, etc.

Requirement Documentation: Creating clear and structured records of user needs (e.g., user stories, use cases).

Requirement Validation: Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, and feasible.

Requirement Management: Keeping track of changes in requirements as the project evolves.

# Where It Fits in the SDLC
Requirement Analysis usually happens early in the SDLC, right after the project is initiated and before design or coding starts. It is foundational for the rest of the development process.
